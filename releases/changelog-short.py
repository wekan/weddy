"""Write CHANGELOG.md, the short changelog, from CHANGELOG-big.md.

  python3 releases/changelog-short.py           # write CHANGELOG.md
  python3 releases/changelog-short.py --check   # exit 1 if it is out of date

CHANGELOG-big.md is the changelog that is written: # Platforms, # Upcoming and every
release in full, with its <details> entries. CHANGELOG.md is only read: the "In short"
paragraph of the unreleased # Upcoming weddy release, when there is one, and
then of each of the five newest releases, with a link to all of its changes - in plain
Markdown, no <details>, <summary> or HTML links. It is never edited by hand: run this
after every change to CHANGELOG-big.md, and tests/changelogShort.test.py fails when it
is not what this writes.

The same rules as WeKan's releases/changelog-short.mjs, for weddy' headings:
"# Upcoming weddy release" and "# <tag> <YYYY-MM-DD> weddy release".
